          <h2>What you need to become an expert</h2>
          <p>To become a subject expert on our platform, you must sign up as an expert and enter your email and
            password.</p>
          <p>You will need to indicate which area of expertise you are in; then, a test will appear, depending on your
            expertise, for
            you to download.</p>
          <p>After registering, You will be given 24 hours to complete the test. If you score 80% and above and submit
            it on time, you will eventually
            qualify to be part of our team. If you fail to achieve 80% or do not submit it on time, you will
            automatically be
            disqualified, and you will try again after 90 days.</p>
          <p>Every question you answer correctly and students approve will remain in your account, and many students can
            access and
            buy it as often as possible.</p>
          <p>As an expert, you can also upload questions and answers you think students need.</p>
          <p>There will be transparency on everything, the questions bought by the students and the earned and payable
            money.</p>
          <p>You will be receiving your payment after every 15 days depending on the number of questions bought by the
            students. It's
            essential to be the first to answer questions depending on the area of expertise.</p>

                  <p>Top earners in ClimaxAnswers make well over $5000 per year, but your ClimaxAnswers earnings will
                    depend on how much
                    effort you are willing to put in.</p>
                  <p>You scroll down the available questions that still need to be answered until you find the one you
                    think you can reply to
                    the most satisfactory. You will be given approximately 2 hours to work on it and submit it. The
                    student who had asked
                    that question will receive a notification in the email that the question asked is already answered.
                    The student can come
                    back and purchase the answer.</p>
                  <p>However, you can earn money by posting questions you have already solvedâ€”post as many questions as
                    possible, followed by
                    their correct answers.</p>
                  <p>The excellent part about ClimaxAnswers is that all the questions answered by experts belong to
                    them. Thus they will earn
                    a lifetime. That is why experts are encouraged to post as many questions as possible to maximize
                    their earnings.</p>
                  <p>ClimaxAnswers takes a commission of 30 to 40 per cent from every question purchased by a student.
                    This is to support the
                    platform to continue offering services to students looking for academic help and subject experts.
